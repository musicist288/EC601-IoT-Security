# IoT Security

## What does the topic cover?

- Maleware is not new, but when considering IoT, the attack surface is larger
  and the impact

- End-to-end encryption of private data
    - Integrity
    - Confidentiality
    - Availability
    - Authorization

- Security architectures that do not prohibitively increase the cost of
  manufacturing and running IoT devices.
    - IoT devices are often resource constrained such that they cannot run
      robust industry-standard secutiry protocols.

- Detecting security breaches

- Securely incorporating new IoT devices onto a trusted network

- Bluetooth Security - Significantly less research than WiFi products
  - InternalBlue - Open source research framework for 


- Common Techniques
    + Minimizing attack surfice

- "Edge computing can help you overcome the cost and complexity of data movement
  and capitalize on new streams of data.""

## Why is it important?

IoT devices are rapidly becoming ubiquitous in people's everyday lives. Smart devices
have been developed and adopted for applications ranging from smart watches, to
in-home heath care sensors such as. 

- More critical infrastructure is internet connected
- More and more personal data is shared between devices or devices and trusted
  providers
- Intel Predictions
    - 55% of All data is forecasted to be generated by IoT in 2025

    - 43% of AI Tasks will happen on edge devices in 2023
      https://www.abiresearch.com/press/hardware-vendors-will-win-big-meeting-demand-edge-ai-hardware/
    - 70% of enterprises will run varying levels of data processing at the IoT
      edge by 2023

## Applications of this topic?

- Healthcare
    - Telemedicine
    - Sensing and uploading patient data for remote monitoring or study
    - Medical devices capable of performing self-maintenance
    - ML Assisted 
    - Smartwatches
        - Heart rate monitoring
        - Improving Posture
        - Detecting seziures
    - Insulin Pens & Glucose Monitoring
        - Pens can sample gluecose levels and mainting a history of reading that
          can be shared with healthcare providers

    - Ingestible Sensors
        - Digestable medical sensors in perscribed medication
        - Helps to ensure patients take their medication 
    - Smart video pills
        - Allows doctors to visualize the gastrointestinal tract without
          invasive surgery.

- Stormwater Management (Opti example)

    - Using local sensors and weather forecasts to smartly drain or retain
      stormwater to minimize flooding and maximize efficieny.
- Industrial IoT
- Telecommunications
- Power Grid


## What is the societal significance of the research?

- Keeping costs down
- Public trust in smart solutions
- Better management of natural resources - Give Opti as an example - but it
  needs to be secure. It could be catestrophoic if bad actors could infultrate
  and control system.

  Discovering vulnerabilities

- IoT Notary: Sensor Data Attestation in Smart Environment
    + Big takeaway: Security handled but informed consent
    + SP - Service Provider
    + A user-centric framework to ensure trustworthy data collection in
      untrusted IoT spaces.
        - Ifrastructure deployer
        - Service provider - establishes list of data capture rules
        - Two ways to notify the user: Notify or ask for concent
        - Secure log-sealing - keeps proof-of-integrity of catured data that
          the user was notified about and agreed to when applicable. Also
          prevents malicious SP to capture data other than what was agreed to
    + Does not deal with attacks on sensors, but can discard data collected that
      doesn't comply with notifications.
